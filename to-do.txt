- use shared pointers instead of pointers everywhere. (replace malloc with these.)
- use merkel hash tree function to store a block's hash. (kind of a reverse binary tree hash, with the level of the current nodes also used to calculate the hash value.)
- write a verify function that can be used to check if the hash stored in a block is the right value.
- transaction structure:
    + add/remove (add/remove specifies whether a key/value pair was added/removed from the overall structure. The blockchain doesn't have to worry about this. It just needs to store transactions)
    + key (string)
    + value (string)
- read transactions from file.
- use strings instead of pointers and arrays.
- block structure:
    + last hash
    + vector<transaction>
    + curr hash
- develop a client server model for the program, look at how zeromq and other things can be used here.
